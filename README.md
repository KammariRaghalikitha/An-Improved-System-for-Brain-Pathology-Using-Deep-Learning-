# Brain Tumor Identification using EEG
This project focuses on the identification of brain tumors using EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. EEG signals are recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp and can provide valuable insights into brain activity. By analyzing EEG data, we aim to develop a system that can accurately detect the presence of tumors in the brain.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The uploaded EEG dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as noise removal, filtering, and feature extraction to enhance the quality of the data and extract relevant information.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizing machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we build a model capable of classifying EEG signals as indicative of brain tumor presence or absence.
Performance Evaluation: The system evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity to assess the effectiveness of the classification model.
User Interface: The project includes a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) built using Tkinter, allowing users to easily upload EEG data, preprocess it, execute the classification module, and view the results.
